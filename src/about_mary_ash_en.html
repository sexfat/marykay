                                After 25 years of hard work in the direct selling industry, Mary Kay resolutely decided to retire.
She wants to build a "dream company" and become a force to support women. Provide opportunities for women to have a deeper imagination and hope for themselves and life and increase the index of happiness and positiveness.

                                    In 1963, she founded MARY KAY with a deposit of US$5,000 and recruited 9 beauty consultants to start selling products and promoting business. In the first year of the establishment of Mary Kay, the number of Mary Kay beauty consultants has grown from 9 to 300, with an annual performance of nearly 200,000 US dollars!

Mary Kay is very proud to say that in her company, women earn 50,000 US dollars a year. The number of people ranks first in the United States!

                                 In 1969, the pink car award program was established and became a trophy symbolizing beauty consultant honor. This is the pink power of Mary Kay, soft but strong. Through color, we can not only beautify our external appearance, but also bring energy, change our lives.
